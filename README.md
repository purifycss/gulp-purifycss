## Usage

```js
var purify = require('gulp-purify');

gulp.task('scripts', function() {
  return gulp.src([
      './public/app/**/*.js',
      './public/**/*.html'
    ])
    .pipe(purify('./public/styles/**/*.css', 'filename.css', { minify: true }))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist/'));
});
```

Options can be found on the [API documentation](https://github.com/purifycss/purifycss#api).

This will purify your CSS files by comparing them to all of the source files provided to `gulp.src`.
This will purify styles into `./dist/filename.css`.
